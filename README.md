## Project Description
"Imagine walking home at night, and your phone quacks to warn you about a crime hotspot nearby—or alerts your parents if you’re in danger. Meet QuackShield.ai, an AI-powered safety app that turns vigilance into an engaging, community-driven experience, starring our mascot Attila the Duck!"
QuackShield.ai revolutionizes community safety by transforming crime awareness into an engaging, user-friendly experience. Designed for students, parents, and neighborhood watch groups, our platform addresses the shortcomings of traditional crime apps—which often feel impersonal or overwhelming—by integrating real-time data with playful duck-themed alerts. The app provides live crime heatmaps, AI-powered danger zone notifications, and a one-tap SOS system, all wrapped in an intuitive interface that encourages innovative proactive safety without inducing anxiety. We also created a SHA key from scratch to fetch it to Flutter.

At its core, QuackShield.ai solves three critical problems: the lack of contextual, real-time crime alerts in high risk areas, and the low engagement rates of youth more likely to be Victims, and the high number of Crimes that go unreported. By gamifying vigilance with duck mascots and with future developments such as achievement badges and educational quizzes and games, we’ve created a tool that users actively want to interact with, bridging the gap between security and accessibility.

## Key Features
The platform’s standout feature is its AI-driven "Quack Alerts" system, which **notifies users—or their designated guardians—when they enter high-risk areas**, with severity tiers mapped to colors. The **interactive heatmap combines with Crime records** which can be improved with crowd-sourced incident reports, filtered by crime type and time window.
For emergencies, **the SOS button triggers a 911 call while simultaneously sharing the user’s live location with trusted contacts**. Educational modules in the "Quack Academy" section teach safety protocols through bite-sized lessons, with potentially rewarding progress with collectible duck badges. The app’s backend can also generates anonymized community safety reports, helping local authorities identify recurring Crime zones.
